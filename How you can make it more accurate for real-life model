You can use the Augmentation technique to make it more accurate.
This model is made by me only on the around 10k images out of all the available images so you can train it on all the images to make it more accurate.
You must have more powerful GPU/CPU to make it run on all images
You can change the activation function of output layer to the Sigmoid in place of sigmoid
You can use the EarlyStopping technique to reach the best output
You can make changes in the layer and number of neurons
You can use dropout method to make stop it from overfitting
.........I will add more about it if I came to know more techniques, since I am also in learnign phase.
